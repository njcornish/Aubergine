### Europe and Western 'interest' and 'ignorance' about the plant

Cultural responses to eggplant in Early Modern Europe were largely dependent on the connection from which eggplant encounters came. Europeans were usually two or three steps removed from the eggplant cultures of India and China, with Iberic and Italian food culture influenced by Islamic and Jewish Mediterranean connections, and English botanists only finding eggplant through their European neighbours. Mattioli in 16th century Italy, largely quoting from the scholar Hermolaos Barbarus writes about how it was ‘generally eaten cooked with oil, salt, pepper and mushrooms’ and adds that ‘there are some of our people who feed on the mad-apple in order to arouse love’. However, he adds that they are hard to digest and create a number of digestive sicknesses and long-lasting illnesses. 16th century Spain and Italy had key connections with the Islamic world in both trade and warfare in a similar way, and thus a third degree connection to the eggplant through Islamic and Jewish food culture. A benefit here is that in Spain and Italy there appears to be no problem in growing the plant, as Fuchs describes them as ‘sown in our gardens, but frequently in … hanging window gardens’ with cucumbers and melons. Fuchs’ german botanical tradition owed much to Swiss and Italian scholarship, and his warmer climate closer to the Swiss border connects him to this botanical culture. Northern Mediterranean eggplant encounters involved some suspicion but were dictated mostly by shared food culture. Fuchs writes, amused, that some people ‘immediately avoid the use of them, terrified by the name itself’ to suggest that suspicion of the eggplant is greatly exaggerated.

The 1678 Hortus Malabaricus shows how this conceptual model informed the first hand encounters of dutch imperialists with their local contacts. Van Rheede, the governor of Dutch Malabar was informed by a distinguished local herbalist called Itty Achudan on plant use. Thus, the first name recorded is the ‘braman name… Vaenna’, and information that ‘the juice relieves cows from internal abscesses and that the fruit was used to cure toothaches is not recorded in any of the european herbals mentioned above. Rheede appears to lament directly that ‘the fruit of the nightshade in our homeland is a narcotic power: but india produces edible nightshades!’. Thus, the eggplant is tied into a Western botanical framework as a miraculous product of far-away lands.
